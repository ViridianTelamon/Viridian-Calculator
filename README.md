# Viridian-Calculator
Viridian Calculator is a Calculations Tool of which was made using Tkinter and Python; I worked on and finished Viridian Calculator about a week ago at this point.  This tool has features like a total equation and current equation label and also keyboard controls as well.  This program is meant to be an alternative to something like the Calculator built into your Operating System or a Calculator on a Website.  

This project was fully made and developed by ViridianTelamon (Me).
